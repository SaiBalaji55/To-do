# To-do
I am using the node js in backend.

## 🚀 My First Backend Project – To-Do List API (Full Stack)

# Excited to share my first backend project 🎉

I built a To-Do List Application using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and connected it with a simple HTML + JavaScript frontend.

# 🔧 Features:

✔ Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations
✔ Tabular view for tasks
✔ Edit & Delete options for each task
✔ Clickable Yes / No toggle for completed status
✔ RESTful API integration
✔ Backend tested using Postman

# 🛠 Tech Stack:

Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Tools: Postman, Git
This project helped me understand API development, backend–frontend connection, and real-world CRUD operations.

# Install Packages
  ```
  npm init -y

  npm install express mongoose cors
  ```
